= Development 

This document is intended for developers and here we show some useful development tips and tricks.

== Useful commands

.List all relevant project files
[source,sh]
find . -type f ! -path "./node_modules/*" ! -path "./.next/*" ! -path "./.env.local" ! -path "./.vscode/*" ! -path "./.git/*" ! -path "./public/cache/*" -print

== Naming Conventions

We aim to keep naming consistent and meaningful across the project.

=== General

- Use `camelCase` for variables, constants, and most functions
- Use `PascalCase` for React components, types, and folders
- Use `kebab-case` or lowercase for filenames that aren't components (e.g. `parseM3U.ts`)
- Match function names to filenames when thereâ€™s a 1:1 relationship (e.g. `parseM3U()` in `parseM3U.ts`)

=== Components

- Place each component in its own folder under `src/components/`
- Component folder and file should match (`ChannelCard/ChannelCard.tsx`)
- Optionally include an `index.ts` file to simplify imports

.Example
[source,ts]
----
import ChannelCard from '@/components/ChannelCard';
----

=== Utilities

- Single-purpose utility functions go in `src/utils/` (e.g. `parseM3U.ts`)
- Multi-function modules may use a folder with `index.ts`

=== Types

- All TypeScript types go in `src/types/`
- Use `PascalCase` for filenames and type names (e.g. `M3UEntry.ts`)
- If a type is domain-specific, prefix accordingly (e.g. `FetchM3URequest.ts`)

=== Configuration

- Use `config/index.ts` as an entry point if needed
- Example and default configs are named like `services.example.ts` / `services.ts`

=== Tests

- Unit tests go in `test/` or near their source file (`__tests__` folder optional)
- Use the same name as the file being tested, but suffixed with `.test.ts`
- Real input assets (e.g. `.m3u` files) go in `test/assets/`

Let me know if you'd prefer this in its own file (`naming-conventions.adoc`) or want a `README-style` summary version for the GitHub front page.
