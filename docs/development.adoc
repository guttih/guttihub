= Development

This document is intended for developers working on this project. It includes useful tips, scripts, and conventions to support local development and testing.

== Next.js Basics

include::next.adoc[]

== Useful Commands

.List all relevant project files (excluding build and cache directories)
[source,sh]
find . -type f ! -path "./node_modules/*" ! -path "./.next/*" ! -path "./.env.local" ! -path "./.vscode/*" ! -path "./.git/*" ! -path "./public/*" ! -path "./html/*" -print

.List and display specific files
[source,sh]
----
find . -type f \( -name "StreamingService.ts" -o -name "M3UEntry.ts" -o -name "parseM3U.ts" -o -name "route.ts" -o -name "page.tsx" -o -name "PlayerClient.tsx" -o -name "PlayerButton.tsx" -o -name "StreamCard.tsx" \) -exec sh -c 'echo {}; cat {}' \;
----

[[npm-scripts]]
include::scripts.adoc[]

== Environment Variables

This project uses a `.env.local` file during development. That same file is copied and renamed to `.env.production` during deployment to simplify config management.

To create the required `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, generate a strong secret with Node.js by running:

[source,sh]
----
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"  # generates a 32-byte secret
----

You can obtain your Google credentials by creating an OAuth 2.0 Client ID from the Google Cloud Console:

ðŸ“Ž https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

Use the "Web application" type. You'll find these options under the "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs" section when creating credentials. Make sure to include the following redirect URIs:

- Authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
- In production: `https://tv.guttih.com/api/auth/callback/google`

.Required Keys
[source,.env]
----
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://tv.guttih.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
----

If `.env.local` is missing or one of these values is not defined, the deploy script will abort and point to this documentation.

Do not commit `.env.local` or `.env.production` to source control.

=== BASE_URL (required in production)

The app needs to know its public URL to generate valid stream links in HLS playlists.

[source,.env]
----
BASE_URL=https://tv.guttih.com
----

If not set in production, scheduled recordings will fail.


== Naming Conventions

Consistent naming improves readability and maintainability.

=== General

- Use `camelCase` for variables, constants, and most functions
- Use `PascalCase` for React components, types, and folders
- Use `kebab-case` or lowercase for filenames that arenâ€™t components (e.g. `parseM3U.ts`)
- Match function names to filenames when thereâ€™s a 1:1 relationship (e.g. `parseM3U()` in `parseM3U.ts`)

=== Components

- Place each component in its own folder under `src/components/`
- Component folder and file should match (e.g. `StreamCard/StreamCard.tsx`)
- Optionally include an `index.ts` to simplify imports

.Example
[source,ts]
----
import StreamCard from '@/components/StreamCard';
----

=== Utilities

- Single-purpose utility functions go in `src/utils/` (e.g. `parseM3U.ts`)
- Multi-function modules may use a folder with an `index.ts`

=== Types

- Place all TypeScript types in `src/types/`
- Use `PascalCase` for filenames and type declarations
- Prefix domain-specific types (e.g. `FetchM3URequest.ts`)

=== Configuration

- Place configuration entry points in `src/config/`
- Example/default files use naming like `services.example.ts` / `services.ts`

=== Tests

In this project, we use https://vitest.dev/[Vitest] for testing. 

- Unit tests go in `test/` or in `__tests__` folders near their targets
- Match the source file name with a `.test.ts` suffix
- Test assets (e.g. `.m3u` files) go in `test/assets/`

== Testing Philosophy

The goal of testing here isn't perfect coverage, but meaningful validation.

Coverage tools are helpful for identifying blind spots, but the focus is on testing the expected behavior of the code â€” both typical and edge cases. It's more important that tests are clear and useful than exhaustive.

The tests are intended to catch unintended side effects and to help identify when a change in one part of the codebase breaks behavior elsewhere. Coverage is a tool, not a target.

== Styling

=== Tailwind CSS Utility Classes

This project uses https://tailwindcss.com/[Tailwind CSS] for styling. Tailwind provides a comprehensive utility-first approach, making it easy to apply styles directly in JSX using class names.

==== Why Tailwind?

Tailwind enables quick prototyping and styling without needing to write custom CSS for most UI needs. It's especially helpful for creating responsive and accessible layouts.

==== Where to Learn More

- ðŸ“˜ https://tailwindcss.com/docs[Tailwind Docs] â€“ the official documentation
- ðŸ’Ž https://tailwindui.com[Tailwind UI] â€“ premium components and templates
- ðŸ§  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss[VSCode IntelliSense Plugin] â€“ class name autocompletion, preview, and linting

You can search the docs by class name, like `bg-blue-500` or `rounded-xl`, to see how they're used.

==== Tailwind in This Project

This project was created using the Next.js CLI, with Tailwind CSS selected during setup.

Tailwind was added via the official `create-next-app` template, which configured PostCSS and Tailwind automatically.

Tailwind is used throughout the project in class names such as:

[source,tsx]
----
<button className="bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
----

==== Editor Integration

For the best development experience, make sure your editor has Tailwind CSS IntelliSense support.

- ðŸ§© https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss[Tailwind IntelliSense for VSCode]

This provides real-time autocomplete, previews, and hover tooltips for Tailwind classes.

== Local Deployment Setup

[NOTE]
====
Quick PM2 Commands:

- Start: `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production`
- Restart: `pm2 reload ecosystem.config.js --env production`
- Logs: `pm2 logs`
- List: `pm2 list`
====


=== Running with PM2

This project uses PM2 for production process management.

.Install PM2 (if not already)
[source,sh]
----
npm install -g pm2
----

.Start the app (production mode)
[source,sh]
----
cd /var/www/guttihub
npm install --omit=dev
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
pm2 save
----

.Check logs and status
[source,sh]
----
pm2 logs
pm2 list
----

.Restart manually if needed
[source,sh]
----
pm2 reload ecosystem.config.js --env production
----

.Enable auto-start after reboot
[source,sh]
----
pm2 startup
pm2 save
----

.App Ports
- Dev: `PORT=3000`
- Prod: `PORT=6301`


To ensure PM2 restarts the app after a server reboot:

[source,sh]
----
pm2 startup systemd
----

You can now control your app with:

[source,sh]
----
pm2 list           # see running apps
pm2 logs           # view logs
pm2 stop guttihub
pm2 restart guttihub
----

For advanced options, see: https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/

=== Creating `services.json` for Deployment

[source,json]
----
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "demo-service",
      "name": "Example IPTV",
      "server": "http://example.com",
      "refreshUrl": "http://example.com/get.php?username=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD&type=m3u_plus&output=ts",
      "viewingBaseUrl": "http://example.com/USERNAME/PASSWORD",
      "username": "USERNAME",
      "password": "PASSWORD",
      "maxConcurrentViewers": 1,
      "hasFileAccess": false,
      "contentCategories": [
        "movies",
        "series",
        ""
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----


=== Production Restart with PM2

After deploying, the application is automatically restarted on the server using PM2.

The deploy script will:

- Copy and prepare `.env.production`
- Upload files to the server
- Install dependencies via `npm install --omit=dev`
- Restart the app using:

[source,sh]
----
PORT=6301 NODE_ENV=production pm2 reload guttihub || \
PORT=6301 NODE_ENV=production pm2 start npm --name guttihub -- run start
----

You can also restart it manually with:

[source,sh]
----
pm2 restart guttihub
----
